# üåæ Advanced Feed Management System

## Overview
The new Feed Management System is a complete redesign that implements smart inventory tracking, usage monitoring, and automated alerts. This system replaces the basic feed inventory with a sophisticated month-based stock management approach.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Core Collections

#### 1. `feedStock` Collection
**Purpose**: Stores monthly baseline and running stock for each feed type.

**Key Features**:
- Month-based inventory management (YYYY-MM format)
- Automatic stock deduction when usage is recorded
- Real-time consumption tracking and predictions
- Low stock and expiry alerts
- Cost analysis and value tracking

**Schema Highlights**:
```javascript
{
  feedType: 'Layer Feed', // Feed type
  month: '2025-01',       // Month identifier
  baselineQuantity: 1000, // Initial stock for the month
  currentQuantity: 750,   // Current available stock
  averageDailyConsumption: 25, // Calculated average
  daysRemaining: 30,      // Projected days until depletion
  status: 'Active'        // Active, Depleted, Expired, Reserved
}
```

#### 2. `feedUsage` Collection
**Purpose**: Tracks daily consumption with detailed metrics.

**Key Features**:
- Daily usage recording with automatic stock deduction
- Environmental factors tracking (weather, temperature)
- Quality observations and health indicators
- Feed efficiency calculations
- Cost analysis per usage

**Schema Highlights**:
```javascript
{
  feedType: 'Layer Feed',
  date: '2025-01-15',
  quantityUsed: 50,
  totalBirds: 200,
  feedPerBird: 0.25,
  weather: 'Sunny',
  qualityObservations: {
    birdAppearance: 'Good',
    feedAcceptance: 'Excellent'
  },
  verified: false
}
```

## üîÑ Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Monthly Stock Setup
**When**: First day of each month
**Who**: Farm manager/supervisor
**Action**: 
- Input available quantity (baseline) for each feed type
- System creates or updates `feedStock` document
- Resets current quantity to baseline quantity

### Step 2: Daily Usage Recording
**When**: Daily (after each feeding)
**Who**: Workers
**Action**:
- Record feed consumption for the day
- System automatically deducts from `currentQuantity`
- Updates consumption averages and predictions

### Step 3: Automated Calculations
**System automatically calculates**:
- Total Feed Stock (KG): Sum of all current quantities
- Days Remaining: Based on consumption patterns
- Cost Analysis: Daily, monthly, and per-bird costs
- Efficiency Metrics: Feed conversion ratios

## ü§ñ Automation Features

### Daily Automation (6:00 AM)
- Updates consumption averages for all feed types
- Checks for low stock and critical alerts
- Monitors items nearing expiry (30 days)
- Predicts stockout dates based on consumption trends
- Updates stock status (Active/Depleted/Expired)

### Monthly Automation (1st day, 7:00 AM)
- Triggers monthly baseline reset reminders
- Archives old records (>1 year)
- Generates comprehensive monthly reports
- Optimizes inventory levels based on consumption patterns

### Weekly Reports (Sundays, 8:00 AM)
- Generates weekly consumption summaries
- Provides efficiency trend analysis
- Identifies optimization opportunities

## üìä Dashboard Features
